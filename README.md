# Color Match!

**Color Match** is a reflex-based mini-game developed in Construct 3.  
Rotate a triangle using your keyboard to match the tip with the color of falling balls. The faster you react, the higher your score!

## 🕹️ Gameplay
Players control a triangle with three colored tips: red, blue, and yellow. Colored balls fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate the triangle to align the matching color with the falling ball before it reaches the center.

**Controls**:
- ▶️ Right Arrow: Rotate right
- ◀️ Left Arrow: Rotate left

## 🎯 Goal
Successfully match each falling ball with the triangle's correct tip. Every correct match increases your score. The speed intensifies as the game progresses.

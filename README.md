## 🕹️ Gameplay
Players control a triangle with three colored tips: red, blue, and yellow. Colored balls fall from the top of the screen, and the player must rotate the triangle to align the matching color with the falling ball before it reaches the center.

**Controls**:
- ▶️ Right Arrow: Rotate right  
- ◀️ Left Arrow: Rotate left  

Successfully match each falling ball with the triangle's correct tip. Every correct match increases your score. The speed intensifies as the game progresses.
